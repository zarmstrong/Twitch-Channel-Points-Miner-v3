    nothing is lost regardless of what happens next), then copies the ones
    the app actually needs going forward into the new standard location -
    old logs are archived but deliberately not carried into the live logs
    folder (see _LEGACY_DIRS_ARCHIVE_ONLY).

    Gated on a marker *inside* the archive folder (config-legacy/.migrated),
    not on whether a legacy config.py still exists - once archived,
    config.py no longer exists at its old path at all, so re-checking that
    on a later run would look identical to "nothing to migrate", and this
    must not run twice regardless (a second run would archive the fresh
    standard-location data instead of the real legacy data). For the same
    reason, "is there anything to do" also can't be answered by checking for
    just config.py: an earlier attempt can fail partway through (e.g.
    "config" moved, then "cookies" hits a locked file) without ever writing
    the marker, at which point config.py is already gone from its old path

    also treats a config-legacy folder that exists without a .migrated
    marker as an interrupted migration to resume, regardless of what's left
    at the old path.

    Whether the copy-forward step for a given item has already run is
    tracked with its own marker inside legacy_root (config-legacy/.<name>
    -copied), not by checking whether `destination` exists: prepare_config()
    can create <standard_dir>/config/config.py on an earlier, ordinary
    launch that happens to run before this legacy data was ever discovered
    (e.g. the user installed the "standard" build and ran it once before
    copying their old portable folder's contents alongside the exe) -
    "destination already exists" is then true for a reason that has nothing
    to do with this migration ever having copied anything, and skipping the
    copy on that basis would silently strand the user's real config behind
    a bootstrap template that looks, from here, indistinguishable from a
    completed migration. The copy itself uses dirs_exist_ok=True so it
    still succeeds (overwriting any such stale content with the real
    archived data) regardless of what, if anything, already sits at
    `destination`.

    process, so it stays visible through that blocked stretch. Best-effort,
    matching this file's other tray_icon.notify use in
    _make_hide_to_tray_handler: never worth failing the quit over.

    Before this shell existed, stopping the miner required an explicit
    Ctrl+C; a bare click on the window's close button must not silently end
    an unattended, hours-long mining session. Returning False from a
    pywebview `closing` handler cancels the close.

    `miner_thread` only needs an `is_alive()` method - a plain Thread, or a
    _MinerThreadHandle for a thread that may not exist yet, both work.

    Guarded by a non-blocking lock against reentrant calls: pywebview's
    WinForms confirmation dialog is a bare `MessageBox.Show()` with no
    owner window, so it does not disable the underlying form - clicking
    the window's close button again (or tray Quit again) while it's up
    re-fires WinForms' FormClosing before this handler has returned.
    Without the guard, that reentrant call would show a second dialog and
    - if confirmed - actually close/dispose the form from inside the
    nested call; the outer call then resumes and tries to close the
    (already-disposed) form again, which crashes pywebview trying to
    remove the same window uid from its instance table twice.

    `quitting` (a threading.Event) is set for the duration of the dialog
    and left set once the user confirms - see launch_shell's `_guarded_show`.
    An unowned MessageBox doesn't just let a second *close* reach the form
    (the reentrancy above); it also leaves the tray's "Show" item, and the
    single-instance listener's remote-show signal, free to fire from their
    own threads while this dialog is up. `window.show()` marshals onto the
    GUI thread via Control.Invoke, which a nested modal message loop like
    MessageBox.Show still pumps - so it can run interleaved with this
    handler tearing the window down, producing the same
    already-removed-from-pywebview's-instance-table crash as the reentrant
    case above, just reached via Show instead of a second Close. Cleared
    again if the user cancels, so Show keeps working normally afterward.
    Defaults to a fresh, private Event when the caller has no tray (and
    thus no Show button to race against).

        `events.closing` fires from inside WinForms' own FormClosing event,
        itself reached only through `destroy()`, which pywebview properly
        marshals onto that thread (`Control.Invoke`). pystray's Quit menu
        item, by contrast, calls back on pystray's *own* icon thread - and
        `create_confirmation_dialog` on Windows is a bare, unmarshaled
        `MessageBox.Show()` with no thread-affinity handling of its own.
        Calling it directly from there (as this used to) could leave the
        whole app stuck after the dialog was answered, with no way to
        actually quit short of killing the process. Routing through this
        event instead keeps the entire confirm-then-stop sequence on the

        (a real, unowned WinForms MessageBox doesn't stop clicks from

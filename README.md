## How to use

The miner uses a persistent Python configuration file at `config/config.py`.
The stable application runner creates the miner, starts analytics when
configured, watches the file for supported changes, and starts mining.

Start with the maintained template:

```sh
mkdir -p config
cp config.example.py config/config.py
```

Edit `config/config.py` and replace all placeholder usernames, passwords, webhook
URLs, and notification credentials. Remove or set optional integrations to
`None` when you do not use them. Never commit the populated file or share it in
logs or issue reports.

### Configuration file

A minimal configuration looks like this:

```python
from TwitchChannelPointsMiner.classes.Settings import FollowersOrder

MINER_CONFIG = {
    "username": "your-twitch-username",
    "enable_analytics": False,
}

STREAMERS = ["streamer1", "streamer2"]

MINE_CONFIG = {
    "followers": False,
    "followers_order": FollowersOrder.ASC,
    "blacklist": [],
    "categories": [],
}

# Set to a dictionary to start the analytics server, or leave as None.
ANALYTICS_CONFIG = None
```

The file is normal Python, so import any enums or settings classes used by its
values. See [config.example.py](config.example.py) for the complete annotated
configuration, including logger integrations, per-streamer settings, predictions,
categories, and analytics.

### Configuration sections

| Name | Passed to | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `MINER_CONFIG` | `TwitchChannelPointsMiner(...)` | Account, priority, default streamer behavior, logging, notifications, and global runtime options. |
| `STREAMERS` | First argument of `mine(...)` | Ordered streamer logins or `Streamer` objects with per-channel overrides. Use `[]` when relying only on followers or categories. |
| `MINE_CONFIG` | Keyword arguments of `mine(...)` | Followers, blacklist, category discovery, Drops diagnostics, and other mining-session options. Do not include `streamers` here. |
| `ANALYTICS_CONFIG` | `analytics(...)` | Analytics server options. Set to `None` to leave the server disabled. |

#### MINER_CONFIG

`MINER_CONFIG` contains account-wide and constructor settings. At minimum, set
`username`. This is also where you configure mining priority, analytics storage,
SSL behavior, logging and notification integrations,
the number of concurrent streams watched, and the default `StreamerSettings`
inherited by channels without overrides. `streams_watched` accepts `1` or `2`
and defaults to `2`. This option allows Twitch Turbo users to limit the miner to
one concurrent viewing session: reports in issue #787 indicate that continuously
mining two channels alongside normal Twitch viewing may contribute to Turbo users
being served ads. Invalid values are logged and replaced with `2`.

`streamer_source_priority` controls which source gets the available viewing
slots first. Its default is configured streamers, followed streamers, ordinary
category discovery, then automatic badge campaigns:

```python
streamer_source_priority=[
    StreamerSource.STREAMERS,
    StreamerSource.FOLLOWERS,
    StreamerSource.CATEGORIES,
    StreamerSource.BADGES,
]
```

Move `StreamerSource.BADGES` to the front to prioritize earning badge Drops.
The existing `priority` rules are applied within each source group.

See [Settings](#settings) for the available priority, logger, streamer, and bet
objects. Keep credentials and integration tokens only in your private
`config/config.py`.

#### STREAMERS

`STREAMERS` is the ordered list of fixed channels. Each entry can be a lowercase
login string or a `Streamer(...)` object when that channel needs custom
`StreamerSettings`. Use an empty list when mining exclusively from followed
channels or category discovery.

Streamer settings follow this precedence: settings on an individual `Streamer`,
then the default `streamer_settings` in `MINER_CONFIG`, then project defaults.
Plain strings in `STREAMERS` use the configured defaults.

Common streamer-list patterns:

```python
# Fixed list
STREAMERS = ["streamer1", "streamer2"]
MINE_CONFIG = {"followers": False, "categories": []}

# All followed channels
STREAMERS = []
MINE_CONFIG = {"followers": True, "followers_order": FollowersOrder.ASC}

# Fixed list plus followers, excluding selected users
STREAMERS = ["streamer1"]
MINE_CONFIG = {
    "followers": True,
    "followers_order": FollowersOrder.DESC,
    "blacklist": ["user1", "user2"],
}
```

#### MINE_CONFIG

`MINE_CONFIG` contains the keyword arguments for the mining session. Use it to
combine followed channels with `STREAMERS`, apply a blacklist, configure follower
ordering, discover channels by category, and control category/Drop diagnostics.
The streamer list itself belongs in `STREAMERS`, not in this dictionary.

#### Category-based Drops

Use `categories` to mine Drops for games without maintaining a fixed list of
streamer usernames. The miner finds configured games with active, incomplete
Drop campaigns, discovers eligible live channels, and adds those channels to the
normal mining session. Categories can be used by themselves or together with
`STREAMERS` and `MINE_CONFIG["followers"] = True`.

Import the category enums (and `ChatPresence` if you want a category-specific
chat policy) before using the examples below:

```python
import logging

from TwitchChannelPointsMiner.classes.Chat import ChatPresence
from TwitchChannelPointsMiner.classes.Settings import (
    CategoryCampaignOrder,
    CategorySort,
)

MINE_CONFIG = {
    "categories": [
        "pokemon-go",
        "warframe",
    ],
    "category_limit": 5,
    "category_sort": CategorySort.VIEWERS_DESC,
    "category_campaign_order": CategoryCampaignOrder.EXPIRATION,
    "category_chat": ChatPresence.NEVER,
    "category_log_level": logging.INFO,
    "category_refresh_interval_hours": 6,
}
```

##### How category discovery works

At startup, the miner:

1. Reads the configured category values and checks current Drop campaigns.
2. Keeps categories that have an active campaign with an incomplete, eligible
   time-based Drop.
3. Resolves each category to its Twitch game and searches for live channels.
4. Applies the Drops tag, campaign-channel, limit, and sorting rules described
   below.
5. Loads the discovered users as category streamers and subscribes to the same
   relevant Twitch events used for explicitly configured streamers.

If no configured category has an active incomplete campaign, category discovery
is skipped. Explicit `streamers` and downloaded followers are unaffected.

Discovered category channels use the miner's default `StreamerSettings`, except
that `category_chat` can override their chat presence. The blacklist also applies
to discovered channels. If a username is both explicitly configured and found by
category discovery, it remains explicitly configured and keeps its explicit
settings.

##### Category configuration reference

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `categories` | `[]` | Category names, slugs, URLs, or category/streamer selectors to discover. |
| `category_drops_enabled` | `True` | Require the live channel to have a `DropsEnabled` tag. This also affects campaign eligibility checks. |
| `category_limit` | `30` | Maximum channels returned by a normal category search. Values below 1 behave as 1. Restricted campaign discovery may select up to 20 live channels per campaign instead. |
| `category_sort` | `CategorySort.VIEWERS_DESC` | Determines how normal category search results are selected and ordered. Enum values and equivalent strings are accepted. |
| `category_campaign_order` | `CategoryCampaignOrder.ORDER` | Preserves configured category order or prioritizes the nearest viable campaign deadline. |
| `category_chat` | `None` | Chat policy for category-discovered streamers. `None` inherits the default streamer setting. |
| `category_log_level` | `logging.INFO` | Severity used for category discovery and refresh messages. |
| `category_refresh_interval_hours` | `6` | Hours between campaign/channel refreshes. Positive values have a 30-minute minimum; `0` disables refresh. |
| `drop_badge_catalog` | `True` | On startup, classify rewards from the shared Drops gist against the shared Twitch badge catalog and persist the result in the config directory. |
| `drop_badge_refresh_interval_hours` | `1` | Hours between checks for new campaigns. Positive values have a one-hour minimum; `0` keeps the startup check but disables periodic checks. |
| `auto_mine_badge_drops` | `False` | Automatically add live channels for active, unearned watch-time badge campaigns. |
| `badge_drop_streamer_limit` | `1` | Live candidates added for each eligible all-channel badge campaign. Accepts `1` or `2`; restricted campaigns use their listed channels. |
| `track_category_streamer_points` | `False` | Include point earn/spend events from category-only streamers in balance tracking and analytics. Explicit streamers are always tracked. |
| `drop_item_art` | `False` | Store and display Drop item artwork URLs in Drops analytics. |
| `print_open_drop_campaigns_on_load` | `False` | Log all open Drop campaigns during startup. Useful for checking category names and campaign dates. |
| `scrape_drop_progress_on_load` | `False` | Read inventory Drop progress immediately at startup. Required for accurate per-session Drop progress in the graceful-shutdown report. |
| `log_drop_checks` | `False` | Enable verbose Drop GraphQL/inventory diagnostics. Leave disabled unless troubleshooting. |

##### Category input formats

The preferred input is the lowercase slug from a Twitch directory URL:

```python
categories=[
    "pokemon-go",  # Preferred Twitch slug
    "Pokémon GO",  # Twitch display name
    "https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/pokemon-go?filter=drops",
    "https://twitchdrops.app/game/pokemon-go",
]
```

Category matching is case- and accent-insensitive, so `Pokémon GO`, `Pokemon GO`,
and `pokemon-go` resolve to the same category. A Twitch URL is useful when the
display name is ambiguous. A twitchdrops.app game URL is useful when its slug
differs from Twitch's slug.

To require one particular live streamer, append its login after a pipe (`|`):

```python
categories=[
    "Call of Duty: Warzone|streamer-name",
    "[Pokémon GO]|[@another-streamer]",
]
```

The optional brackets and leading `@` are removed. The pipe is the separator so
punctuation in names such as `Call of Duty: Warzone` remains safe. The forced
streamer is accepted only when they are live in the requested category and, when
`category_drops_enabled=True`, have the `DropsEnabled` tag. A forced selector is
not supported on a URL; use the category name or slug form.

##### Channel selection and sorting

`category_sort` accepts a `CategorySort` member or its string value:

| Value | Selection behavior |
|---|---|
| `ORDER` | Keep Twitch's API order. |
| `VIEWERS_DESC` | Highest viewer count first. This is the default. |
| `VIEWERS_ASC` | Lowest viewer count first. |
| `STARTED_AT_DESC` | Most recently started streams first. |
| `STARTED_AT_ASC` | Longest-running streams first. |
| `RANDOM` | Shuffle the eligible candidates. |

For `ORDER` and `VIEWERS_DESC`, the miner requests enough eligible results to
fill `category_limit`. Other sorts inspect a wider candidate window—up to three
times the limit, capped at 300—before selecting the final results. An invalid
sort value falls back to `VIEWERS_DESC`.

Twitch restricts effective watching capacity; adding many discovered channels
does not mean all of them accrue progress simultaneously. Use a modest
`category_limit`, campaign ordering, and the project's normal priority settings
to keep the active set useful. See [Limits](#limits).

##### Campaign filtering and ordering

With `category_drops_enabled=True`, the miner requires a Drops-enabled live
channel and filters categories using eligible Drop campaign information. Set it
to `False` only when you intentionally want live channels from a category even
without the Drops tag.

Campaigns that Twitch reports as completed are excluded from active category
discovery. For badge rewards, the miner also checks the authenticated account's
full available badge inventory. This prevents an already-earned badge campaign
from keeping a category active when the normal Drops inventory omits that
reward.

`CategoryCampaignOrder.ORDER` preserves the order in `categories`.
`CategoryCampaignOrder.EXPIRATION` prioritizes categories whose viable campaigns
expire soonest, helping time-sensitive Drops get selected first.

If Twitch's campaign sources do not list any campaign for a configured game, the
miner uses the shared `twitch-drops.json` gist as a third-priority fallback.
Restricted campaign channel lists are checked in full for live users
while the campaign is active. Shared logins eligible for multiple active
campaigns are checked first. The miner selects up to 20 live channels per
restricted campaign and checks remaining channel lists in standby batches only
when a campaign has not reached that target.

##### Refresh behavior

The miner periodically rechecks configured categories for new campaigns and live
replacement streamers. `category_refresh_interval_hours` defaults to 6 hours,
has a minimum of 30 minutes for any positive value, and adds a random delay of
20 seconds to 5 minutes. During active restricted-campaign discovery, the miner
may temporarily refresh as often as every five minutes to work through standby
channel batches. Set the value to `0` to disable all periodic category checks.

Refreshes add newly discovered streamers but do not remove channels that were
loaded earlier. Restart the miner to fully discard stale or removed category
streamers. In Docker/config mode, changing `MINE_CONFIG["categories"]` triggers
discovery after the configuration watcher detects the edit; other category
options require a restart. See [Configuration reload limitations](#configuration-reload-limitations).

The Drop badge catalog runs independently of category discovery. Its startup
check begins in a background thread after normal miner setup completes, and it
checks hourly thereafter by default. It reads normalized campaign and badge data
from the `twitch-drops.json` and `twitch-badges.json` gists. The game signature
is compared with the saved state, so only new or changed campaign data is
processed. Full Twitch badge records, game snapshots,
classifications, and historical campaign records are stored in
`drop_badge_catalog.json` beside `config.py`. Rewards confirmed by Twitch are
marked `BADGE`; unmatched rewards remain `UNKNOWN` rather than being assumed not
to be badges.

Set `auto_mine_badge_drops=True` to use that catalog to add eligible live
channels automatically. The feature only considers active watch-time campaigns,
skips badges already available to the authenticated account, honors `blacklist`,
and uses `category_chat` and `category_sort`. Subscription-only rewards are not
added because watching cannot earn them. Automatically selected streamers always
have `claim_drops=True`. This feature is disabled by default.

##### Category logging and analytics

`category_log_level` controls category discovery and refresh records separately
from unrelated logs. For example, `logging.DEBUG` lets category diagnostics pass
an `INFO` console threshold without turning on global debug output. Use
`log_drop_checks=True` only for deeper Drop API/inventory debugging because it
can produce substantially more output.

By default, point balance events from category-only streamers are ignored to
avoid noisy or misleading analytics across transient channels. Set
`track_category_streamer_points=True` to include them. A streamer that is also in
the explicit `streamers` list is always tracked. `drop_item_art=True` enriches the
Drops analytics table with item artwork, while `scrape_drop_progress_on_load=True`
populates current inventory progress at startup.

##### Category examples

Prioritize the closest-expiring configured Drop campaigns, preferring
lower-viewer channels and never joining their chats:

```python
MINE_CONFIG = {
    "categories": ["warframe", "diablo-iv", "the-elder-scrolls-online"],
    "category_limit": 3,
    "category_sort": CategorySort.VIEWERS_ASC,
    "category_campaign_order": CategoryCampaignOrder.EXPIRATION,
    "category_chat": ChatPresence.NEVER,
    "category_drops_enabled": True,
}
```

Mix permanent streamers, followers, and category discovery:

```python
STREAMERS = ["favorite-streamer"]
MINE_CONFIG = {
    "followers": True,
    "blacklist": ["blocked-streamer"],
    "categories": ["arc-raiders", "warframe|preferred-streamer"],
    "category_limit": 5,
    "track_category_streamer_points": True,
}
```

##### Category troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to check |
|---|---|
| No category streamers are loaded | Confirm the game has an active, incomplete campaign and try its Twitch directory URL. Enable `print_open_drop_campaigns_on_load=True` to inspect detected campaigns. |
| A live channel is skipped | With `category_drops_enabled=True`, it must have the `DropsEnabled` tag. Restricted campaigns may also require the channel to be on the campaign's allowlist. |
| A forced streamer is skipped | Confirm the login is live, streaming the requested game, and has the Drops tag when required. |
| The chosen channels are unexpected | Check `category_sort`, `category_limit`, category order, and `CategoryCampaignOrder`. Restricted campaign allowlists take precedence over a normal category search. |
| A removed category still affects selection | Refresh only adds streamers; restart the miner to remove already-loaded category channels. |
| Category messages are missing | Set `category_log_level=logging.INFO` or `logging.DEBUG` and ensure the logger/console threshold permits that level. |
| Analytics omit channel point changes | Set `track_category_streamer_points=True`; it defaults to `False` for category-only channels. |

#### ANALYTICS_CONFIG

Set `ANALYTICS_CONFIG` to `None` when the web server is not needed. Otherwise,
provide the keyword arguments for `analytics(...)`, such as `host`, `port`,
`refresh`, `days_ago`, `password`, and `log_poll_interval`. Analytics storage
also requires `MINER_CONFIG["enable_analytics"] = True`. See [Analytics](#analytics)
for configuration and security guidance.

### Local installation

Clone the repository, create an isolated environment, install dependencies, and
copy the configuration template. Python 3.11 through 3.14 is supported.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zarmstrong/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v3
cd Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v3
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows PowerShell: .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdir -p config
cp config.example.py config/config.py
```

Edit `config/config.py`, then continue to [Starting the miner](#starting-the-miner).

### Starting the miner

When running a clone, point the stable runner at the local configuration
directory:

```sh
python -m TwitchChannelPointsMiner.runner --config-dir ./config
```

Docker images already use this runner and default to `/usr/src/app/config`, so no
command override is needed. On first authentication the process may require an
interactive terminal. Cookies, logs, and analytics data are stored separately
from the configuration and should be persisted as described in [Docker](#docker).

The runner checks `config/config.py` every five seconds. Set
`TCPM_CONFIG_RELOAD_SECONDS` to change the interval; the minimum is one second.

At startup, the runner checks `CONFIG_VERSION`. Unversioned configurations are
backed up as `config.py.v0.bak` and upgraded in place. The migration adds missing
global `StreamerSettings` fields with their defaults and appends newly introduced
priority values to the existing priority list without reordering it. A config
created by a newer unsupported release is rejected rather than rewritten. The
obsolete Twitch `MINER_CONFIG["password"]` field is removed from both the active
configuration and any migration backup; Twitch authentication uses the TV
activation flow instead.
Generated Python is parsed before replacement. If an earlier migration left an
invalid file and a versioned backup exists, startup rebuilds the config from that
backup without overwriting it.

#### Configuration reload limitations

- New entries in `STREAMERS` are applied without a restart. Removing a streamer
  does not remove its loaded state, chat connection, or PubSub subscriptions;
  restart the miner to remove it completely.
- Changes to `MINE_CONFIG["categories"]` trigger discovery after the watcher
  detects the edit. Previously discovered channels remain loaded until restart.
- Changes to existing streamer settings, `MINER_CONFIG`, `ANALYTICS_CONFIG`, and
  non-category `MINE_CONFIG` options require a restart.
- Invalid configuration is logged and ignored. The watcher retries after the
  file changes again.

### Docker

#### Docker Hub
Official Docker images are on https://hub.docker.com/r/zacharmstrong/twitch-channel-points-miner for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. The same tags are also published to the legacy https://hub.docker.com/r/zacharmstrong/twitch-channel-points-miner-v2 repository so existing installations continue to receive updates.

The ARM64 image can run in compatible 64-bit Android Linux environments where
the device reports `aarch64` or `arm64-v8a`. Android itself is not a supported
Docker host, and users are responsible for providing a suitable container,
chroot, or Linux compatibility layer. Older 32-bit ARMv7 devices are not
supported.

Maintainers building or publishing images from source should follow the
[Docker image build guide](BUILD.md#docker-images).

The image reads `/usr/src/app/config/config.py`. Create and mount a host `config`
directory. When that directory is empty on first launch, the container copies
the bundled [config.example.py](config.example.py) to `config/config.py` and
exits. Customize the new file, then start the container again. If you normally
use restart policies like `restart: unless-stopped` or `--restart unless-stopped`,
run the initial seed launch with restarts disabled (`restart: "no"` or
`--restart no`) so the container stays stopped while you edit `config/config.py`.
After editing, restore your preferred restart policy before launching the
container again. The container entrypoint starts the stable runner on
subsequent launches.

Persist these directories on the host:

- `analytics`: analytics history and Drop data
- `cookies`: saved Twitch authentication
- `logs`: miner log files
- `config`: the user-owned configuration

**Example using docker-compose:**

```yml
version: "3.9"

services:
  miner:
    image: zacharmstrong/twitch-channel-points-miner
    restart: unless-stopped
    stop_grace_period: 60s
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
    environment:
      - TERM=xterm-256color
      - TZ=America/Denver
    volumes:
      - ./analytics:/usr/src/app/analytics
      - ./cookies:/usr/src/app/cookies
      - ./logs:/usr/src/app/logs
      - ./config:/usr/src/app/config
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
```

**Example with docker run:**
```sh
docker run \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    --stop-timeout 60 \
    -e TZ=America/Denver \
    -v $(pwd)/analytics:/usr/src/app/analytics \
    -v $(pwd)/cookies:/usr/src/app/cookies \
    -v $(pwd)/logs:/usr/src/app/logs \
    -v $(pwd)/config:/usr/src/app/config \
    -p 5000:5000 \
    zacharmstrong/twitch-channel-points-miner
```

Set `TZ` to your [IANA time zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones),
for example `America/New_York`, `Europe/London`, or `Asia/Tokyo`. This controls
the local time used in container logs and timestamps. If `TZ` is omitted, the
container uses UTC.

`$(pwd)` does not work in Windows Command Prompt. Use absolute host paths there,
such as `/path/to/cookies:/usr/src/app/cookies`.

On Windows, use absolute host paths. For example, mount
`C:\Absolute\Path\config` at `/usr/src/app/config`.

#### Graceful Docker shutdowns

The miner handles Docker's normal `SIGTERM` stop signal and writes its
graceful-shutdown report after stopping its worker threads. This applies to
`docker stop`, `docker restart`, and normal Docker Compose stop, restart, down,
and recreate operations.

Docker's default stop grace period is commonly only 10 seconds. Shutdown can
take longer while chat, WebSocket, campaign-sync, and badge-catalog workers
finish. Configure at least 60 seconds so Docker does not send `SIGKILL` before
the report is written:

```yaml
services:
  miner:
    stop_grace_period: 60s
    restart: unless-stopped
```

For `docker run`, use the equivalent `--stop-timeout 60` and
`--restart unless-stopped` options. The restart policy controls recovery after
process or host restarts; it does not replace the stop grace period.

An immediate `docker kill`, an out-of-memory kill, a host crash, or power loss
cannot run shutdown code and therefore cannot produce an end report. Reports
are stored in the mounted `logs` directory, so keep that directory persistent.

For a non-default container path, set `TCPM_CONFIG_DIR` and mount the host
directory at the same location. Users upgrading from the legacy runner should
follow [Migrating from run.py](#migrating-from-runpy) once; new installations do
not need a legacy file.

Directories that are not mounted are created inside the container and their data
is lost when the container is removed. On first authentication, run the container
interactively with `-it` so you can complete the Twitch login.

For multiple accounts, give each container separate config, cookie, log, and
analytics directories, and use a different host port for each analytics server:

```sh
docker run --name user1 -it \
    -v $(pwd)/user1/config:/usr/src/app/config \
    -v $(pwd)/user1/cookies:/usr/src/app/cookies \
    -v $(pwd)/user1/logs:/usr/src/app/logs \
    -v $(pwd)/user1/analytics:/usr/src/app/analytics \
    -p 5001:5000 \
    zacharmstrong/twitch-channel-points-miner
```

```sh
docker run --name user2 -it \
    -v $(pwd)/user2/config:/usr/src/app/config \
    -v $(pwd)/user2/cookies:/usr/src/app/cookies \
    -v $(pwd)/user2/logs:/usr/src/app/logs \
    -v $(pwd)/user2/analytics:/usr/src/app/analytics \
    -p 5002:5000 \
    zacharmstrong/twitch-channel-points-miner
```

#### Portainer

See the [Portainer deployment guide](https://github.com/zarmstrong/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v3/wiki/Deploy-with-Portainer)
for persistent storage, container settings, first-time authentication, analytics,
and updates.

### Replit

This repository does not currently maintain an official Replit deployment.

### Limits
_**Twitch has a limit - you can't watch more than two channels at one time. Set
`streams_watched` to `1` or `2` in `MINER_CONFIG` to control how many are watched
concurrently; the default is `2`. The highest-priority streamers are selected.**_

The `streams_watched` option exists because each mined channel creates viewing
activity on the account. Twitch Turbo users have reported that running two mined
streams continuously, especially while also watching Twitch normally, may result
in ads being served ([upstream issue #787](https://github.com/rdavydov/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2/issues/787)).
Setting the option to `1` reduces the miner's concurrent viewing activity. It is
a mitigation rather than a guarantee, because Twitch does not document this
behavior.

Make sure to write the streamers array in order of priority from left to right. If you use `followers=True` you can choose to download the followers sorted by follow date (ASC or DESC).

## Settings
Most settings are documented inline in [config.example.py](config.example.py).
The `priority` option controls which eligible streamers receive the available
watch slots. It accepts one `Priority` value or an ordered list. Include at least
one fallback such as `ORDER`, `POINTS_ASCENDING`, or `POINTS_DESCENDING`; using
only `STREAK`, for example, leaves no selection rule after available streaks have
been handled.

Available values:
 - `STREAK` - Catch the watch streak from all streamers
 - `FAVORITE` - Prioritize streamers with `StreamerSettings(favorite=True)`
 - `DROPS` - Claim all drops from streamers with drops tags enabled
 - `SUBSCRIBED` - Prioritize streamers you're subscribed to (higher subscription tiers are mined first)
 - `ORDER` - Following the order of the list
 - `POINTS_ASCENDING` - On top the streamers with the lowest points
 - `POINTS_DESCENDING` - On top the streamers with the highest points

Priorities can be combined in order. Avoid contradictory fallback rules such as
`ORDER` and `POINTS_ASCENDING` in the same list.

Set `points_limit` in `StreamerSettings` to stop watching a streamer once its
channel-points balance reaches that value. A pending watch streak can temporarily
bypass the limit so its reward is not missed. Set `favorite=True` per streamer
and include `Priority.FAVORITE` to reserve watch slots for favorites first.

### LoggerSettings

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `save` | bool | `True` | Save logs to rotating files. |
| `less` | bool | `False` | Use compact log formatting and shorter messages. |
| `console_level` | logging level | `logging.INFO` | Minimum level written to the console. |
| `console_username` | bool | `False` | Include the account username in console and notification messages. |
| `time_zone` | str or None | `None` | Log time zone, such as `America/Denver`. |
| `date_format` | str | `"dd/mm/yy"` | Date format used in logs and analytics. Use `dd`, `mm`, and `yy` or `yyyy`, separated by `/`, `-`, or `.`. |
| `file_level` | logging level | `logging.DEBUG` | Minimum level written to log files. |
| `emoji` | bool | Platform-dependent | Enable emoji; defaults to disabled on Windows and enabled elsewhere. |
| `colored` | bool | `False` | Enable colored console output. |
| `auto_clear` | bool | `True` | Rotate logs daily and retain seven backups. |
| `color_palette` | ColorPalette | Default palette | Customize colors by event. |
| `telegram` | Telegram or None | `None` | Send selected events through Telegram. |
| `discord` | Discord or None | `None` | Send selected events through Discord. |
| `webhook` | Webhook or None | `None` | Send selected events to a generic HTTP endpoint. |
| `matrix` | Matrix or None | `None` | Send selected events to a Matrix room. |
| `pushover` | Pushover or None | `None` | Send selected events through Pushover. |
| `gotify` | Gotify or None | `None` | Send selected events to a Gotify server. |
| `email` | Email or None | `None` | Send selected events through an SMTP server. |
| `daily_report` | bool | `False` | Generate a daily channel-points and Drop activity report. |
| `daily_report_time` | str | `"00:00"` | Local delivery time for the daily report, in 24-hour `HH:MM` format. |

#### Email / SMTP

Email uses Python's built-in SMTP support and adds no dependency. Subscribe the
notifier to `Events.DAILY_REPORT` to receive daily summaries; other event types
can be included in the same list for immediate email alerts.

```python
from TwitchChannelPointsMiner.classes.Email import Email
from TwitchChannelPointsMiner.classes.Settings import Events

Email(
    host="smtp.example.com",
    port=587,
    username="miner@example.com",
    password="YOUR_SMTP_PASSWORD",
    sender="miner@example.com",
    recipients=["you@example.com"],
    events=[Events.DAILY_REPORT, Events.CONFIGURATION],
    starttls=True,
)
```

Use `use_ssl=True, starttls=False` for implicit TLS, commonly on port 465. SMTP
failures are handled like the other alert transports and do not stop mining.
Daily-report progress is saved per account under `logs/.state/`, so point and
Drop baselines survive normal stops and restarts. If the scheduled delivery was
missed while the miner was stopped, the overdue report is sent after startup
finishes refreshing current streamer balances.

#### Color Palette
`ColorPalette` customizes console colors by event name. Unspecified events use
`Fore.RESET`, while prediction wins and losses default to green and red. Values
may be Colorama constants or case-insensitive color names: `BLACK`, `RED`,
`GREEN`, `YELLOW`, `BLUE`, `MAGENTA`, `CYAN`, `WHITE`, or `RESET`.
```python
from colorama import Fore
ColorPalette(
    STREAMER_ONLINE = Fore.GREEN,
    STREAMER_OFFLINE = Fore.RED,
    GAIN_FOR_RAID = Fore.YELLOW,
    GAIN_FOR_CLAIM = Fore.YELLOW,
    GAIN_FOR_WATCH = Fore.YELLOW,
    GAIN_FOR_WATCH_STREAK = Fore.YELLOW,
    BET_WIN = Fore.GREEN,
    BET_LOSE = Fore.RED,
    BET_REFUND = Fore.RESET,
    BET_FILTERS = Fore.MAGENTA,
    BET_GENERAL = Fore.BLUE,
    BET_FAILED = Fore.RED,
)
```

#### Telegram
To receive selected log events through Telegram, configure a `Telegram`
instance; otherwise omit the option or set it to `None`.
1. Create a bot with [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
2. Get your `chat_id` with [@getmyid_bot](https://t.me/getmyid_bot)

| Key | Type | Default | Description |

| `chat_id` | int | Required | Numeric Telegram chat ID. |
| `token` | str | Required | Bot token issued by BotFather. |
| `events` | list | Required | Events to send. |
| `disable_notification` | bool | `False` | Send without sound or vibration when enabled. |

```python
Telegram(
    chat_id=123456789,  # Replace with your numeric chat ID.
    token="YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
    events=[Events.STREAMER_ONLINE, Events.STREAMER_OFFLINE,
                    Events.BET_LOSE, Events.CHAT_MENTION],
    disable_notification=True,
)
```

otherwise omit the option or set it to `None`.
1. Go to the Server you want to receive updates
2. Click "Edit Channel"
3. Click "Integrations"
4. Click "Webhooks"
5. Click "New Webhook"
6. Name it if you want
7. Click on "Copy Webhook URL"


| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `webhook_api` | str | Required | Discord webhook URL. |
| `events` | list | Required | Events to send. |

```python
Discord(
   webhook_api="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID/YOUR_WEBHOOK_TOKEN",
   events=[Events.STREAMER_ONLINE, Events.STREAMER_OFFLINE,
                    Events.BET_LOSE, Events.CHAT_MENTION],
)
```

#### Generic Webhook
Use `Webhook` to send selected events to an HTTP endpoint.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `endpoint` | str | Required | Destination URL. |
| `method` | str | Required | `POST` or `GET`. |
| `events` | list | Required | Events to send. |
| `timeout` | float | `10` | Request timeout in seconds. |

`GET` requests send `event_name` and `message` as query parameters. `POST`
requests send them as form fields in the request body.

```python
Webhook(
   endpoint="https://example.com/webhook",
   method="GET",
   events=[Events.STREAMER_ONLINE, Events.STREAMER_OFFLINE,
                    Events.BET_LOSE, Events.CHAT_MENTION],

### BetSettings

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `strategy` | Strategy | `SMART` | Prediction outcome-selection strategy. |
| `percentage` | int | `5` | Percentage of the current balance to place. |
| `percentage_gap` | int | `20` | Percentage-point gap used by the SMART strategy. |

| `delay_mode` | DelayMode | `FROM_END` | How prediction timing is calculated. |
| `delay` | float | `6` | Timing value interpreted according to `delay_mode`. |

#### Bet strategy

- **MOST_VOTED**: Select the option most voted based on users count
- **HIGH_ODDS**: Select the option with the highest odds
- **PERCENTAGE**: Select the option with the highest percentage based on odds (It's the same that show Twitch) - Should be the same as select LOWEST_ODDS
- **SMART_MONEY**: Select the option with the highest points placed.
- **SMART**: If the majority in percent chose an option, then follow the other users, otherwise select the option with the highest odds
- **NUMBER_1**: Always select the 1st option, BLUE side if there are only two options
- **NUMBER_2**: Always select the 2nd option, PINK side if there are only two options
- **NUMBER_3**: Always select the 3rd option
- **NUMBER_4**: Always select the 4th option
- **NUMBER_5**: Always select the 5th option
- **NUMBER_6**: Always select the 6th option
- **NUMBER_7**: Always select the 7th option
- **NUMBER_8**: Always select the 8th option

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2/master/assets/prediction.png)

Here is a concrete example:

- **MOST_VOTED**: 21 users selected **“over 7.5”**, compared with 9 for “under 7.5.”
- **HIGH_ODDS**: The highest odd is 2.27 on **'over 7.5'** vs 1.79 on 'under 7.5'
- **PERCENTAGE**: The highest percentage is 56% for **'under 7.5'**
- **SMART**: Calculate the percentage based on the users. The percentages are: 'over 7.5': 70% and 'under 7.5': 30%. If the difference between the two percentages is higher than `percentage_gap` select the highest percentage, else the highest odds.

With `percentage_gap=20`, the 40-point difference exceeds the threshold, so the
miner selects “over 7.5.”
#### FilterCondition

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `by` | OutcomeKeys | `None` | Prediction value to evaluate. |
| `where` | Condition | `None` | Comparison operator. |
| `value` | number | `None` | Comparison target. |

Allowed values for `by` are:
- `PERCENTAGE_USERS` (no sum) [Would never want a sum as it'd always be 100%]
- `ODDS_PERCENTAGE` (no sum) [Doesn't make sense to sum odds]
- `ODDS` (no sum) [Doesn't make sense to sum odds]
- `DECISION_USERS` (no sum)
- `DECISION_POINTS` (no sum)
- `TOP_POINTS` (no sum) [Doesn't make sense to the top points of both sides]
- `TOTAL_USERS` (sum)
- `TOTAL_POINTS` (sum)

Allowed values for `where` are: `GT, LT, GTE, LTE`

##### Example

Require more than 200 total participants:

```python
FilterCondition(by=OutcomeKeys.TOTAL_USERS, where=Condition.GT, value=200)
```

Require the selected outcome's odds to be at least 1.3:

```python
FilterCondition(by=OutcomeKeys.ODDS, where=Condition.GTE, value=1.3)
```

Require the largest prediction to be below 2,000 points:

```python
FilterCondition(by=OutcomeKeys.TOP_POINTS, where=Condition.LT, value=2000)
```

#### DelayMode

- **FROM_START**: Will wait `delay` seconds from when the bet was opened
- **FROM_END**: Wait until `delay` seconds remain in the prediction window
- **PERCENTAGE**: Will place the bet when `delay` percent of the set timer is elapsed

Here's a concrete example. Let's suppose we have a bet that is opened with a timer of 10 minutes:

- **FROM_START** with `delay=20`: The bet will be placed 20s after the bet is opened
- **FROM_END** with `delay=20`: The bet will be placed 20s before the end of the bet (so 9mins 40s after the bet is opened)
- **PERCENTAGE** with `delay=0.2`: The bet will be placed when the timer went down by 20% (so 2mins after the bet is opened)

## Analytics

The optional analytics server provides a browser-based view of channel-point
history, Drops, and miner logs. The points chart includes tooltips with the
balance, timestamp, and gain or spend reason. Annotations highlight predictions,
watch streaks, and other significant changes, and can be disabled in the page.
The interface also includes light and dark themes.

| Light theme | Dark theme |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| ![Light theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2/master/assets/chart-analytics-light.png) | ![Dark theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2/master/assets/chart-analytics-dark.png) |

Enable storage with `MINER_CONFIG["enable_analytics"] = True` and configure the
server through `ANALYTICS_CONFIG`. The chart refreshes every `refresh` minutes.
The log viewer polls every `log_poll_interval` seconds (default `5`; accepted
range `1` to `180`), and `days_ago` controls the chart's initial time range.

For access from another machine, bind to `0.0.0.0` and provide a strong
`password`; remote binds without a password are rejected. Sign in with the
configured Twitch username and analytics password. The built-in server uses
plain HTTP, so expose it only on a trusted network or behind an HTTPS reverse
proxy. Background and design context are available in [issue #96](https://github.com/Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2/issues/96).
```python
MINER_CONFIG = {
    "username": "your-twitch-username",
    "enable_analytics": True,
}

ANALYTICS_CONFIG = {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 5000,
    "refresh": 5,
    "days_ago": 7,
    "log_poll_interval": 5,
}
```

### Analytics security and HTTPS reverse proxy

The analytics server contains account activity and miner logs. Its built-in authentication uses HTTP Basic authentication, which does not encrypt credentials or response data. Binding it to `0.0.0.0` exposes it to every reachable network interface; use a strong, unique analytics password and do not expose port 5000 directly to the internet.

For remote access, keep the miner bound to loopback and terminate HTTPS in a reverse proxy. A minimal nginx location looks like this:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name analytics.example.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/analytics.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/analytics.example.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
    }
}
```

Set `ANALYTICS_CONFIG={"host": "127.0.0.1", "password": "a-strong-password"}`
behind that proxy. Restrict the proxy further with a firewall, VPN, or IP
allowlist where possible. nginx and certificate provisioning must be configured
for your operating system and domain; the example only shows the relevant proxy
boundary.

### Enabling analytics storage

Disabling analytics reduces memory and disk use because the miner does not create
or update analytics JSON files.

Set `MINER_CONFIG["enable_analytics"]` to `True` when using the analytics server.
Otherwise leave it `False` (the default).

## Logs

Logging is controlled by `LoggerSettings` in `MINER_CONFIG`. The default full
format includes timestamps, levels, function names, streamer state, point gains,
Drop activity, and prediction decisions. Set `less=True` for shorter console
messages while retaining the important event details.

### Full format

```text
14/07/26 12:00:00 - INFO - [run]: 💣 Start session: 'session-id'
14/07/26 12:00:02 - INFO - [set_online]: 🥳 Streamer(username=streamer-name, channel_id=0000000, channel_points=12000) is Online!

```

### Compact format

```text

14/07 12:06:00 - 🎁 Claiming the bonus for streamer-name (12k points)!
```

### Graceful-shutdown report

During a controlled shutdown—such as `Ctrl+C` or Docker's normal stop signal—the
miner summarizes session duration, the log path, prediction results, and points
gained or spent per streamer and event type. It also reports Drop rewards whose
progress changed during the session, including watched minutes, minutes gained,
required minutes, and final status. Enable `scrape_drop_progress_on_load` to
capture the startup baseline required for this part of the report. When it is
disabled, the miner does not make an implicit startup inventory request or
estimate Drop gains from an incomplete baseline. Docker users should configure
the [recommended stop grace period](#graceful-docker-shutdowns). A hard kill,
host crash, or power loss cannot produce this report.

```text
14/07/26 18:00:00 - 🛑 Ending session: 'session-id'

Existing Docker users can let the image convert a conventional legacy runner on
first startup. The conversion preserves imports and expressions while splitting
the old calls into the four current configuration values.

### Automatic Docker migration

1. Back up the existing `run.py` and container configuration.
2. Create an empty, persistent host directory named `config`.
3. During the first upgraded start, mount both the directory and the old runner:

   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - ./config:/usr/src/app/config
     - ./run.py:/usr/src/app/run.py
   ```

4. Recreate the container. When `/usr/src/app/config/config.py` is absent, the
   entrypoint converts `/usr/src/app/run.py`, validates the result, and starts
   with the new configuration.
5. Check the startup output, inspect `config/config.py`, and confirm the account,
   streamers, mining options, notifications, and analytics server behave as
   expected.
6. Remove the `run.py` mount and recreate the container again. Keep only the
   persistent config directory for future upgrades.

After a successful conversion, the converter renames the legacy runner to
`run.py.bak` so it cannot be mistaken for the active configuration. It refuses
to overwrite either an existing `config/config.py` or `run.py.bak`. The new
configuration has owner-only permissions, and `config/.converted-from-run-py`
records the source path and SHA-256 hash.

### What converts automatically

The legacy file must contain exactly one `TwitchChannelPointsMiner(...)` call,
exactly one `.mine(...)` call, and no more than one `.analytics(...)` call. The
converter maps them as follows:

| Legacy expression | New configuration value |
|---|---|
| Arguments to `TwitchChannelPointsMiner(...)` | `MINER_CONFIG` |
| First positional argument to `.mine(...)` | `STREAMERS` |
| Keyword arguments to `.mine(...)` | `MINE_CONFIG` |
| Arguments to `.analytics(...)` | `ANALYTICS_CONFIG`, or `None` when absent |

Imports needed by enums and settings objects are retained. Expanded `**kwargs`,
extra positional arguments, multiple miner/mine calls, or syntax errors cannot
be converted safely.

### Persisted data versions

User-owned formats are checked when their corresponding feature starts:

- `config/config.py` uses `CONFIG_VERSION` and is migrated before execution.
- Streamer analytics JSON and `drops_by_category.json` use a root `version` and
  are migrated when analytics is enabled. Pre-migration files are retained as
  `<filename>.v0.bak`.
- Watch-streak state and `drop_badge_catalog.json` already carry independent
  version fields checked by their loaders.
- Cookie JSON keeps Twitch's cookie-dictionary shape and is not wrapped in a
  project schema. Authentication remains responsible for validating it.

Migrations are idempotent and refuse to overwrite an existing backup or consume
a format version newer than the running release.

If conversion fails, any incomplete output is removed, a migration warning is
printed, and the original runner executes unchanged. Correct the legacy file and
remove any partial config before retrying, or create `config/config.py` manually
from [config.example.py](config.example.py). Set
`TCPM_DISABLE_AUTO_CONVERSION=1` only when you intentionally need to postpone
conversion; the container will continue using the mounted legacy runner.

To convert without starting the miner, run the image's runner with
`--convert-only` while mounting both paths. This writes the converted config but
does not launch mining. Conversion still refuses to replace an existing config.

```sh
docker run --rm \
    -v $(pwd)/config:/usr/src/app/config \
    -v $(pwd)/run.py:/usr/src/app/run.py \
    zacharmstrong/twitch-channel-points-miner --convert-only
```

## Legacy cookie migration (optional)

This section applies only if you are upgrading from an older version or the
original miner and already have a working `twitch-cookies.pkl`. New users can
skip it—the miner creates the account cookie file after normal authentication.

The current account file is `cookies/<twitch-username>.pkl`, where the filename
must match `MINER_CONFIG["username"]`. Despite the historical `.pkl` extension,
new files contain validated JSON rather than Python pickle data.

To reuse an old cookie:

1. Stop the miner.
2. Back up the old cookie file. Treat it like a password: it contains an
   authentication token and must not be committed, shared, or included in logs.
3. Create the persistent `cookies` directory if it does not exist.
4. Copy and rename the old file to match the configured Twitch login:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p cookies
   cp /path/to/twitch-cookies.pkl cookies/your-twitch-username.pkl
   ```

5. Start the miner normally. If the file contains the supported legacy
   data-only cookie list, the miner loads it with a restricted parser, validates
   its structure, rewrites it as JSON, and limits its permissions to the owner.

For Docker, the host directory must be mounted at `/usr/src/app/cookies` as shown
in [Docker](#docker). The same per-account filename rule applies inside the
mounted directory. Use a separate cookie and config directory for each account.

The legacy cookie may no longer be accepted by Twitch. If the miner reports an
invalid or unsafe file, remove it and authenticate again. If Twitch rejects a
previously valid saved token, the miner clears the cached login and restarts so
that reauthentication can occur; follow the instructions printed in the logs.

## Windows
The Windows executable does not require Python, Git, or Command Prompt. Keep its
folder private because it will contain your Twitch login and saved session.

### Install the Windows executable

1. Open the project's
   [Releases page](https://github.com/zarmstrong/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v3/releases)
   and select the newest release.
2. Under **Assets**, download the file named
   `TwitchChannelPointsMiner-<version>.zip`. Do not download **Source code**.
3. Open your **Downloads** folder, right-click the downloaded ZIP file, and
   select **Extract All...**.
4. Choose a permanent location that you can easily find, such as
   `Documents\TwitchChannelPointsMiner`, and select **Extract**. Do not run the
   program from inside the ZIP file.
5. Open the extracted folder and double-click `TwitchChannelPointsMiner.exe`.
   The first run creates the configuration file and then closes. This is normal.

Only download the executable from the project's official Releases page. If
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen appears, check that the publisher warning names
`TwitchChannelPointsMiner.exe` and that you used the link above. Then select
**More info** followed by **Run anyway**. If the file came from anywhere else,
delete it instead.

### Set up your account

1. In the extracted folder, open the new `config` folder.
2. Right-click `config.py`, select **Open with**, and choose **Notepad**. Keep the
   `.py` filename; do not rename it to `.txt`.
3. Find `your-twitch-username` and replace it with your Twitch login name.
4. Find the `STREAMERS = [` section near the middle of the file. Replace the
   example streamer names with the channels you want to watch. Use login names
   from their Twitch URLs, without `https://twitch.tv/` or the `@` symbol.
5. Review the other settings and comments in the file. In particular, remove or
   disable example notification services that you do not use. The
   [configuration guide](#configuration-file) explains every section and links
   to the complete examples.
6. In Notepad, select **File > Save**, then close Notepad.

The generated file is the full configuration template. You can return to it
later to enable followed channels, Drops categories, predictions,
notifications, and other settings without starting over.

### Start the miner

Double-click `TwitchChannelPointsMiner.exe` again. Leave the black console window
open while the miner is running and follow any Twitch sign-in instructions it
shows. To stop the miner, click the console window and press `Ctrl+C`, or close
the window.

The miner saves its settings, login session, and logs in folders beside the
executable. Do not move the executable by itself after setup; move the entire
`TwitchChannelPointsMiner` folder if you want it in a different location.

### Update the miner

1. Stop the running miner.
2. Download and extract the newest release as described above.
3. Copy the new `TwitchChannelPointsMiner.exe` into your existing miner folder.
4. When Windows asks, choose **Replace the file in the destination**.
5. Start the miner normally. Your existing configuration and login data remain
   in place.

### Windows troubleshooting

- **The window closes the first time:** This is expected. Open
  `config\config.py`, finish [Set up your account](#set-up-your-account), and run
  the executable again.
- **Windows says it cannot find the configuration:** Right-click the downloaded
  ZIP and use **Extract All...** before running the executable.
- **Notepad saved `config.py.txt`:** In File Explorer, enable **View > Show >
  File name extensions**, then rename the file to `config.py`.
- **Emoji or symbols look broken:** In `config.py`, use
  `LoggerSettings(emoji=False)` in `MINER_CONFIG["logger_settings"]`. See
  [LoggerSettings](#loggersettings) for the complete example.
- **The miner closes or reports an error after setup:** Open the `logs` folder
  beside the executable and check the newest log file. Remove account names,
  cookies, tokens, and passwords before sharing a log in a bug report.

Developers who want to create the executable from source can use the
[Windows build guide](BUILD.md#windows-executable).

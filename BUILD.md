# Building Release Artifacts

This guide covers every release artifact that can be built from the repository:
the standalone Windows executable and Docker images. Run all commands from the
repository root.

## Windows executable

### Prerequisites

- Windows with Python 3.11 or newer
- The project dependencies
- [PyInstaller 6.21.0](https://pyinstaller.org/)

Install the build dependencies:

```powershell
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
py -m pip install pyinstaller==6.21.0
```

Build the executable:

```powershell
.\build_windows.bat
```

The build produces `dist\TwitchChannelPointsMiner.exe`. Copy it to a writable
directory before running it. The executable's first-launch configuration and
upgrade behavior are documented in the [Windows section](README.md#windows) of
the main README.

Tagged releases that contain code changes run the same build automatically and
attach a versioned `TwitchChannelPointsMiner-<version>.zip` to the GitHub
release. See [the release workflow](.github/workflows/release-please.yml) for
the automated build definition.

## Docker images

This section explains how to build this project locally and publish it to a
Docker Hub repository. The tagging follows
[the Docker deployment workflow](.github/workflows/deploy-docker.yml).

Docker builds **images**. A container is created later when an image is run.

### Prerequisites

- Docker Engine or Docker Desktop
- A Docker Hub account
- Repositories named `twitch-channel-points-miner` and
  `twitch-channel-points-miner-v2` in the namespace you will publish to
- A Docker Hub personal access token with read and write permission

The official images use the `zacharmstrong` namespace.

For a multi-platform build, Docker must also have the Buildx plugin. Docker
Desktop includes Buildx; recent Docker Engine installations normally include
it as the `docker-buildx-plugin` package.

### Set the image name and version

Replace the example values with your Docker Hub username or organization and
the version you are publishing:

```sh
export DOCKERHUB_NAMESPACE="your-dockerhub-username"
export DOCKERHUB_USERNAME="your-dockerhub-username"
export IMAGE="${DOCKERHUB_NAMESPACE}/twitch-channel-points-miner"
export LEGACY_IMAGE="${DOCKERHUB_NAMESPACE}/twitch-channel-points-miner-v2"
export VERSION="3.0.0"
```

`DOCKERHUB_NAMESPACE` may be an organization while `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` is the
account that has permission to push to it.

### Log in to Docker Hub

```sh
docker login --username "${DOCKERHUB_USERNAME}"
```

Enter the personal access token when Docker asks for a password. Do not put the
token in this repository or directly in a shell command.

### Option 1: Build and push for the current platform

This is the quickest way to test the Dockerfile and publish an image for the
same CPU architecture as the development machine:

```sh
docker build --pull \
    --tag "${IMAGE}:${VERSION}" \
    --tag "${IMAGE}:latest" \
    --tag "${LEGACY_IMAGE}:${VERSION}" \
    --tag "${LEGACY_IMAGE}:latest" \
    .
```

Confirm that all local tags exist:

```sh
docker image inspect "${IMAGE}:${VERSION}"
docker image inspect "${IMAGE}:latest"
docker image inspect "${LEGACY_IMAGE}:${VERSION}"
docker image inspect "${LEGACY_IMAGE}:latest"
```

Push all tags:

```sh
docker push "${IMAGE}:${VERSION}"
docker push "${IMAGE}:latest"
docker push "${LEGACY_IMAGE}:${VERSION}"
docker push "${LEGACY_IMAGE}:latest"
```

This method publishes only the development machine's architecture. Use the next
option for an AMD64 and ARM64 release.

### Option 2: Build and push a multi-platform release

Create a reusable Buildx builder. This only needs to be done once:

```sh
docker buildx create \
    --name tcpm-builder \
    --driver docker-container \
    --use
docker buildx inspect --bootstrap
```

If the builder already exists, select it instead:

```sh
docker buildx use tcpm-builder
docker buildx inspect --bootstrap
```

Before building, check the `Platforms` line from the inspect command. It must
include `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. If it lists only AMD64 and 386 on a
standalone Linux Docker Engine host, ARM QEMU/binfmt emulation has not been
registered. Docker's documented installation method is:

```sh
docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install arm64
```

This pulls and runs a privileged helper that registers the ARM64 emulator on
the host. Review the [Docker multi-platform build documentation][docker-qemu]
before using it on a shared or production host. Afterward, recreate the builder
and inspect it again. Docker Desktop normally provides emulation automatically.

[docker-qemu]: https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/#install-qemu-manually

Build AMD64 and ARM64 and push the version and `latest` tags directly to Docker
Hub:

```sh
docker buildx build --pull \
    --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
    --tag "${IMAGE}:${VERSION}" \
    --tag "${IMAGE}:latest" \
    --tag "${LEGACY_IMAGE}:${VERSION}" \
    --tag "${LEGACY_IMAGE}:latest" \
    --push \
    .
```

The `--push` flag is required because a multi-platform result cannot be loaded
as one image into the classic local Docker image store. Buildx publishes a
manifest that points to the image for each supported architecture.

#### ARMv7 limitation

The project currently pins `pandas==2.2.3`. PyPI does not provide a compatible
32-bit ARM wheel for this configuration, so pip attempts to compile pandas and
its NumPy build dependency from source. Under QEMU this is extremely slow and
can fail with errors such as:

```text
qemu-arm: QEMU internal SIGSEGV
c++: internal compiler error: Segmentation fault signal terminated program cc1plus
ERROR: Failed to build 'pandas' when installing build dependencies for pandas
```

For a reliable ARMv7 release, attach a native ARMv7 build node to the Buildx
builder and build that platform there. Do not assume that an emulated ARMv7
build is stuck merely because `Preparing metadata (pyproject.toml)` runs for a
long time; pip may be compiling hundreds of NumPy source files without a wheel.
The recommended local command above publishes AMD64 and ARM64 only.

### Verify the published images

Inspect the Docker Hub manifest and confirm that it lists AMD64 and ARM64:

```sh
docker buildx imagetools inspect "${IMAGE}:${VERSION}"
docker buildx imagetools inspect "${IMAGE}:latest"
docker buildx imagetools inspect "${LEGACY_IMAGE}:${VERSION}"
docker buildx imagetools inspect "${LEGACY_IMAGE}:latest"
```

You can also pull the image normally to test the variant for the current
machine:

```sh
docker pull "${IMAGE}:${VERSION}"
```

Run it using the configuration and volume mounts documented in the
[Docker section of the README](README.md#docker).

### Publishing another version

Change `VERSION`, then repeat the selected build and push commands:

```sh
export VERSION="1.0.1"
```

Only update `latest` when the new version should become the default Docker Hub
release. To publish a version without changing `latest`, remove both `latest`
tag arguments from the build command and do not push those tags.

### Troubleshooting

- `denied: requested access to the resource is denied`: check the namespace,
  repository name, token permissions, and the logged-in account.
- `multiple platforms feature is currently not supported`: select a Buildx
  builder that uses the `docker-container` driver.
- ARM builds fail before the Dockerfile runs: ensure
  `docker buildx inspect --bootstrap` reports `linux/arm64`. On a Linux host,
  QEMU/binfmt emulation may need to be installed by the system administrator.
  Do not start the multi-platform build until that platform is reported.
- `archive/tar: invalid tar header` while unpacking the base image: retry once
  in case the registry download was interrupted. If it happens again, recreate
  the disposable Buildx builder to discard its content store and cached layers:

  ```sh
  docker buildx rm tcpm-builder
  docker buildx create \
      --name tcpm-builder \
      --driver docker-container \
      --use
  docker buildx inspect --bootstrap
  ```

  Recreating this builder removes its build cache, but does not remove normal
  Docker images or running containers. Confirm that the inspect output includes
  ARM64 before retrying the build.

  If a fresh builder still fails on `WORKDIR`, or the error moves between ARMv7
  and ARM64, create a separate builder using BuildKit's `native` snapshotter.
  This avoids the failing overlay-backed cache-key scan. The BuildKit version is
  pinned here to keep the workaround reproducible:

  ```sh
  docker buildx create \
      --name tcpm-builder-native \
      --driver docker-container \
      --driver-opt image=moby/buildkit:v0.29.0 \
      --buildkitd-flags '--oci-worker-snapshotter=native' \
      --use
  docker buildx inspect tcpm-builder-native --bootstrap
  ```

  If `tcpm-builder-native` already exists, select it instead of creating it
  again:

  ```sh
  docker buildx use tcpm-builder-native
  docker buildx inspect tcpm-builder-native --bootstrap
  ```

  In the inspect output, confirm that the snapshotter label is `native` and the
  `Platforms` line includes ARM64. Then select this builder for the publish
  command:

  ```sh
  docker buildx build \
      --builder tcpm-builder-native \
      --pull \
      --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
      --tag "${IMAGE}:${VERSION}" \
      --tag "${IMAGE}:latest" \
      --push \
      .
  ```
- Docker Hub shows only one architecture: the image was probably built with
  `docker build` or without the full `--platform` list. Rebuild it with the
  multi-platform command above.
- The ARMv7 build spends a long time at `Preparing metadata (pyproject.toml)`
  and then reports a QEMU or compiler segmentation fault: pip is compiling
  NumPy from source because no compatible wheel is available. Publish AMD64 and
  ARM64 locally, or build ARMv7 on a native ARMv7 Buildx node.
